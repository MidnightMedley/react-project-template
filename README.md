# React Project Template

This is a simple React template with basic setup.

It contains:

* Tools to load React from Webpack (`@babel/preset-react`, etc.)
* `react-router-dom` with a simple error page and a home page
* `styled-components`
* `feather-icons`

To run the development server:

``` 
npm run serve
```

To build:

```
npm run build
```

*It builds with the code already minified!*

Have fun =)
